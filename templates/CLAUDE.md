# Claude Code Instructions - [PROJECT NAME]

## Project Context & Purpose

[Describe your project's purpose and key business context here]

**Key Business Context:**
- **Target Users**: [Who are your users?]
- **Core Problem**: [What problem does this solve?]
- **Primary Benefits**: [What value does this provide?]

## Architecture Overview

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
[Describe your architecture pattern here, e.g.:
API Layer (FastAPI routes)
    â†“
Service Layer (Business logic)
    â†“
Repository Layer (Data access)
    â†“
Model Layer (Database ORM)
]
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework**: [e.g., FastAPI, Django, Express]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB]
- **Testing**: [e.g., pytest, Jest, JUnit]
- **Package Manager**: [e.g., uv, npm, pip]
- **Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.13, Node 18]

## Critical Development Rules

### 1. Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS follow Double Loop TDD when adding features:**
1. **Outer Loop**: Write acceptance/E2E test first â†’ RED â†’ Get user confirmation â†’ Inner Loop
2. **Inner Loop**: Write unit test â†’ RED â†’ Get user confirmation â†’ Write code â†’ GREEN â†’ Refactor â†’ Commit
3. Repeat inner loop until acceptance test passes
4. Refactor at outer loop level when feature complete
5. Get user review before final commit
6. See @DEVELOPMENT.md for complete Double Loop TDD methodology

### 2. Commit Strategy (REQUIRED)
**MUST commit after completing each logical step:**
- Use descriptive commit messages with format:
```
Title describing the change

Following: [Original user request or context]

- Bullet points of specific changes made
- Include technical details
- Reference any specs or requirements

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints/annotations throughout
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exceptions with proper error codes
- **Validation**: Use validation libraries for all input/output
- **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting with clear naming

## Project Structure Navigation

### Key Files to Understand First:
[List the 5-10 most important files developers should read first]
1. **`path/to/main.py`** - Entry point
2. **`path/to/config.py`** - Configuration
3. **`path/to/models/`** - Data models
4. **`path/to/api/`** - API endpoints
5. **`tests/conftest.py`** - Test configuration

### Core Data Models:
[Describe your primary data models and their relationships]
- **Model1**: [Description]
- **Model2**: [Description]
- **Model3**: [Description]

### Common Enums/Constants:
[List important enums or constants used throughout the project]
```
STATUS_ENUM = ["pending", "active", "complete", "cancelled"]
```

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding a New API Endpoint:
1. **Schema**: Define validation models
2. **Repository**: Add data access methods
3. **Service**: Add business logic
4. **API**: Add route handler
5. **Tests**: Create test cases

### Working with the Database:
[Provide common patterns for database operations in your project]

### Repository Pattern:
[Provide example of repository pattern if used]

### Service Pattern:
[Provide example of service pattern if used]

## Testing Approach

### Test Structure:
- **`tests/conftest.py`**: Test configuration and fixtures
- **`tests/test_*.py`**: Test files following naming convention

### Running Tests:
```bash
[command to run all tests]
[command to run specific tests]
[command to run with coverage]
```

### Test Fixtures Available:
[List available test fixtures and their purpose]

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development:
```bash
# Setup environment
[setup commands]

# Start development server
[start command]

# Access points:
# - API: [URL]
# - Docs: [URL if applicable]
```

### Making Database Changes:
```bash
# Create migration
[migration create command]

# Apply migrations
[migration apply command]
```

## API Design Patterns

[If building an API, describe your endpoint naming conventions]

### Endpoint Naming:
- `GET /api/v1/resources/` - List resources
- `POST /api/v1/resources/` - Create resource
- `GET /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Get specific resource
- `PUT /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Update resource
- `DELETE /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Delete resource

## Key Business Logic

[Describe important business rules, workflows, or domain logic]

### Important Workflows:
1. [Workflow 1 description]
2. [Workflow 2 description]

### Relationships:
[Describe key relationships between entities]

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:
1. **Import Errors**: [How to resolve]
2. **Database Errors**: [How to resolve]
3. **Test Failures**: [How to resolve]
4. **Build/Runtime Errors**: [How to resolve]

### Debugging Tools:
[List debugging approaches and tools]

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features:
[List upcoming features or technical debt to address]

### Scalability Notes:
[Describe scalability considerations or migration paths]

## Working with Specifications

**Primary Spec**: [Link to main specification document]
**Implementation Plan**: [Link to implementation plan if exists]

When adding features:
1. Reference user stories or requirements documentation
2. Implement data model requirements from specs
3. Follow API behavior requirements from specs
4. Include business logic per specifications

## Success Criteria

When development is complete, the system should:
- âœ… [Criterion 1]
- âœ… [Criterion 2]
- âœ… [Criterion 3]
- âœ… Have comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Follow clean architecture patterns
- âœ… Include proper error handling and validation

Remember: [Add your project's core values or principles here]

- Always use [package manager] to modify dependencies. Do not edit the dependency file directly.
- Do not update non-test code before writing or updating tests. You MUST follow the test-driven development workflow in @DEVELOPMENT.md.
- You MUST follow @DEVELOPMENT.md for all development.
- You MUST NEVER add comments to code explaining what the code does.
- [Add any other project-specific rules]
