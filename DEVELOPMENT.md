## Architecture & Project Structure

### Layered Architecture - Responsibilities and Guidelines

This project follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern with clearly defined layers. Each layer has specific responsibilities and should only communicate with adjacent layers.

#### Architecture Layers

[Customize this section based on your architecture. Below is an example for a typical web API:]

#### 1. API Layer (`api/`) - HTTP Interface
**Responsibility**: Handle HTTP request/response cycle, input validation, and API concerns.

**What belongs here:**
- Route handlers
- HTTP status code decisions
- Query parameter parsing and validation
- Request/response serialization
- HTTP-specific error handling
- API versioning concerns

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Business logic or domain rules
- Database queries or data transformations
- Complex validation beyond HTTP concerns

#### 2. Schema Layer (`schemas/`) - Data Contracts
**Responsibility**: Define API input/output contracts and validation rules.

**What belongs here:**
- Validation models for API requests/responses
- Input validation rules
- Data serialization/deserialization logic
- Documentation for API

#### 3. Service Layer (`services/`) - Business Logic
**Responsibility**: Implement domain business rules, orchestrate operations, and coordinate between repositories.

**What belongs here:**
- Business logic and domain rules
- Workflow orchestration
- Cross-repository operations
- Business validation
- Domain-specific calculations
- Transaction boundaries

#### 4. Repository Layer (`repositories/`) - Data Access
**Responsibility**: Abstract database operations and provide clean data access interface.

**What belongs here:**
- Database queries
- Data filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Complex queries involving joins
- Database transaction management
- Data mapping between ORM and service layer

#### 5. Model Layer (`models/`) - Data Structure
**Responsibility**: Define database schema and data relationships.

**What belongs here:**
- ORM model definitions
- Database table structure
- Relationships between entities
- Database-level validation
- Enums for controlled vocabularies

#### Layer Communication Rules

**Allowed dependencies** (top-to-bottom only):
```
API â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Model
API â†’ Schema (for validation)
Service â†’ Schema (for type contracts)
```

**Forbidden dependencies**:
- Models should NEVER import from upper layers
- Repositories should NEVER import from Service or API layers
- Services should NEVER import from API layer
- Circular dependencies between any layers

## Development Workflow - Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**CRITICAL**: This project follows strict TDD methodology. Failure to follow these rules will result in rejected code.

### MANDATORY Development Rules

**RULE 1: ALWAYS WRITE TESTS BEFORE NON-TEST CODE**
- You MUST write tests before writing ANY implementation code
- This includes: database migrations, validation changes, route updates, package changes, text changes, exception behavior, error responses, literally EVERYTHING
- Tests are your feedback mechanism - they tell you if your changes work
- No exceptions to this rule

**RULE 2: IMMEDIATE COMMITS REQUIRED**
- You MUST create a git commit immediately after editing ANY files
- Every file change must be committed before proceeding
- Use descriptive commit messages following the format specified in this document
- Never batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit

**RULE 3: COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE**
Tests must cover EVERYTHING, including but not limited to:
- Database migrations and their end states
- Schema validation changes
- API route updates and new endpoints
- Package dependency changes
- User-facing text and message changes
- Exception handling and error responses
- Business logic changes
- Data transformations
- Authentication and authorization
- Configuration changes

**RULE 4: [PROJECT-SPECIFIC DATABASE RULES]**
[Customize based on your database:]
- Never delete the database file
- Use proper migration strategies
- Always use [package manager] to modify dependencies

**RULE 5: CODE STANDARDS**
- Never add comments to code explaining what it does
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use type hints throughout
- Handle errors appropriately

### TDD Process

1. **Write Tests First**: Always write tests before implementing any code
2. **Test Structure**: Use mocking to isolate layers not yet implemented
3. **Test-Fail Cycle**: Ensure tests fail correctly due to:
   - Import errors for non-existent modules/classes
   - `NotImplementedError` exceptions
   - NOT syntax errors or missing imports
4. **User Confirmation Required**: MUST stop and allow user to confirm or make changes to failing tests before proceeding to implementation
5. **Layer Implementation**: Implement in order based on your architecture
6. **Implementation Rules**:
   - Implement only ONE layer at a time
   - Fill dependencies with stubs raising `NotImplementedError`
   - Run tests iteratively and update until passing
   - Stop for review once tests pass

### Development Loop
Write tests â†’ Run tests (fail) â†’ **STOP for user confirmation** â†’ Write minimal code â†’ Run tests (pass) â†’ Commit immediately â†’ Repeat
