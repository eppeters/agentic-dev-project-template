Is this information correct?

Type "yes" to proceed with setup, or tell me what needs to be changed.
```

## Template Customization Process

Once the user confirms, perform these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Files to Keep/Remove

**For REST API projects (type 1)**:
- Keep all files

**For non-REST API projects (types 2-7)**:
- Delete `.claude/HTTP_STATUS_CODES.md`
- Delete `.claude/agents/http-status-reviewer.md`

### Step 2: Fill in CLAUDE.md

Replace all placeholders:
- `[PROJECT NAME]` → project name
- `[Describe your project's purpose...]` → purpose, users, benefits
- `[Describe your architecture pattern...]` → architecture description with actual pattern
- `[e.g., FastAPI, Django...]` → actual framework
- `[e.g., PostgreSQL...]` → actual database
- `[e.g., pytest, Jest...]` → actual testing framework
- `[e.g., uv, npm...]` → actual package manager
- `[e.g., Python 3.13...]` → actual language and version
- **Key Files** section → actual file paths from project structure
- **Core Data Models** section → actual models from question 12
- **Common Enums** section → actual enums/constants from question 13
- `[command to run...]` → actual commands
- All example code blocks → adjust language/framework syntax

### Step 3: Fill in DEVELOPMENT.md

Replace all placeholders:
- `[PROJECT NAME]` → project name
- `[Brief description...]` → purpose
- `[Component Role]` → based on project type
- Architecture section → customize layer descriptions based on actual architecture
- `[language]` in code blocks → actual language
- Project structure diagram → actual structure from question 14
- `[Prerequisites...]` → based on tech stack
- `[install command]` → actual installation command
- `[start command]` → actual dev server command from question 16
- `[test command]` → actual test commands from question 17
- `[migration command]` → actual migration commands from question 18

### Step 4: Update user-story-implementer.md

- Update example code blocks to use the correct language syntax
- Update references to package manager
- Update database-specific rules (if applicable)

### Step 5: Create Project Structure

If user wants you to create the initial directory structure:
- Create the directories based on question 14
- Create placeholder files for entry point, tests, etc.
- Initialize git if not already initialized

## Output Format

After completing the setup, provide:

```markdown
## ✅ Project Setup Complete!

I've customized all the TDD workflow templates for your project:

### Files Updated
- ✅ CLAUDE.md (customized with your project details)
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md (customized with your tech stack)
- ✅ .claude/agents/user-story-implementer.md (updated for your language)
[- ❌ Removed .claude/HTTP_STATUS_CODES.md (not a REST API)]
[- ❌ Removed .claude/agents/http-status-reviewer.md (not a REST API)]

### Project Structure
[Show the directory tree if created]

### Next Steps

1. **Review the generated files**: Check that everything looks correct
2. **Initialize your repository** (if not done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup with TDD workflow templates"
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   [actual installation command]
   ```
4. **Start implementing features**: Use the `/feature` command to begin

### Quick Commands

**Start development server**:
```bash
[actual dev command]
```

**Run tests**:
```bash
[actual test command]
```

**Implement a feature**:
Use the `/feature` command in Claude Code to start the TDD workflow

Your project is ready! All template placeholders have been filled in with your specific information.

## Conversation Guidelines

1. **Be conversational**: Ask questions naturally, not like a form
2. **Provide context**: Explain why you're asking each question
3. **Offer examples**: Help users understand what kind of information you need
4. **Be flexible**: If a question doesn't apply, skip it or adapt
5. **Validate answers**: If an answer seems unclear, ask for clarification
6. **Show progress**: Let the user know you're making progress through the interview
7. **Be encouraging**: This is the start of a new project - be enthusiastic!

## Error Handling

If the user:
- **Doesn't know something yet**: Suggest "TBD / Will define later" as placeholder
- **Gives unclear answer**: Politely ask for clarification with examples
- **Wants to skip questions**: Allow it and note what will need manual updates
- **Changes their mind**: Restart from the changed section

Remember: Your goal is to make project setup effortless. The more information you gather, the less manual work the user has to do!
